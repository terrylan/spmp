# Standard PHP-MVC-Principles (SPMP)

SPMP is a lightweight PHP MVC framework designed for structured application development. It focuses on modularity, security, and adaptability, with AI-assisted configuration and optimization features.

## Overview
SPMP provides a structured approach to PHP-based development, emphasizing:
- **Lightweight design** – Minimal dependencies for performance optimization.
- **Security-first principles** – Built-in CSRF protection, input sanitization, and secure database access.
- **Modular and extendable architecture** – Supports virtual modifications without altering core files.
- **AI-assisted automation** – Enables AI-driven project scaffolding and optimization.

## Getting Started
The repository contains essential documentation for understanding and configuring SPMP:
1. **Reference Documents**:
   - `docs/SPMP-RAG.v6.1.yaml`: Core framework principles, structure, and AI-driven optimizations (updated as of March 16, 2025).
   - `docs/SPMP-Project.md`: A structured template for defining project specifications.
   - `examples/SimpleERP.md`: A sample project specification for an ERP system.

2. **Define Your Project**:
   To customize SPMP for a specific use case, fill out `SPMP-Project.md` with project details. The template covers essential configurations, including:
   - Database and security settings
   - Role-based access requirements
   - Feature customization (e.g., caching, real-time updates, API support)

3. **AI-Assisted Code Generation**:
   SPMP integrates with AI-assisted tools for automated project generation. Example workflow:
   - Attach `SPMP-RAG.v6.1.yaml` and `SPMP-Project.md` to an AI prompt.
   - Use an instruction such as: "Generate an SPMP-based application using the attached project specifications."
   - The AI will generate code tailored to the provided constraints.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic AI Templates** – Configurable models, controllers, and database layers based on project needs.
- **Hardware-Aware Optimizations** – Automatically adjusts caching, queuing, and database preferences based on system specifications.
- **Modular Structure** – Supports additional plugins and virtual modifications (vQmod) without modifying core files.
- **Security Enhancements** – Includes authentication, role-based access control (RBAC), and API token management.
- **Multi-Tenancy & Cloud Support** – Configurable for isolated user environments and scalable cloud deployments.

## Future Enhancements
The following improvements are planned to extend SPMP’s capabilities in version 6.1 and beyond:
- **Progressive Web App (PWA) Support** – Enable offline capabilities, push notifications, and app-like experiences.
- **Serverless Deployment** – Adapt SPMP for serverless architectures (e.g., AWS Lambda) for cost-effective scaling.
- **Microservices Architecture** – Break SPMP into modular services for distributed deployments.
- **AI-Powered Analytics** – Integrate real-time user behavior and performance analytics with AI insights.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Integration** – Add chatbots or voice commands to SPMP apps.
- **Low-Code/No-Code Interface** – Provide a visual builder for non-developers to create apps.
- **Blockchain Integration** – Support secure transactions and data integrity via blockchain.
- **Edge Computing Optimization** – Optimize for low-latency processing on edge devices (e.g., IoT).
- **Multi-Language Support (i18n)** – Enable internationalization for multilingual apps.
- **Automated Testing Framework** – Build a suite for unit, integration, and performance tests.
- **Containerization Support** – Provide Docker/Kubernetes integration for easy deployment.
- **Dynamic Theme Engine** – Allow runtime theme switching (e.g., light/dark mode).
- **Rate Limiting and Throttling** – Protect apps from abuse with request limits.
- **Offline-First Data Sync** – Enable offline functionality with automatic syncing.
- **Voice Command Interface** – Integrate voice recognition for hands-free control.
- **AI-Driven Code Refactoring** – Use AI to optimize and improve code quality.
- **Cross-Platform Mobile Support** – Generate mobile apps (iOS/Android) using frameworks like Capacitor.
- **Predictive Caching** – Pre-cache data based on AI-predicted user behavior.
- **Zero-Downtime Updates** – Enable seamless updates without interrupting users.
- **Quantum Computing Readiness** – Prepare SPMP for future quantum computing environments.
