# Standard PHP-MVC-Principles (SPMP)

SPMP is a lightweight PHP MVC framework designed for structured application development. It focuses on modularity, security, and adaptability, with AI-assisted configuration and optimization features.

## Overview
SPMP provides a structured approach to PHP-based development, emphasizing:
- **Lightweight design** – Minimal dependencies for performance optimization.
- **Security-first principles** – Built-in CSRF protection, input sanitization, and secure database access.
- **Modular and extendable architecture** – Supports virtual modifications without altering core files.
- **AI-assisted automation** – Enables AI-driven project scaffolding and optimization.

## Getting Started
The repository contains essential documentation for understanding and configuring SPMP:
1. **Reference Documents**:
   - `docs/SPMP-RAG.md`: Core framework principles, structure, and AI-driven optimizations.
   - `docs/SPMP-Project.md`: A structured template for defining project specifications.
   - `examples/SimpleERP.md`: A sample project specification for an ERP system.

2. **Define Your Project**:

To customize SPMP for a specific use case, fill out SPMP-Project.md with project details. The template covers essential configurations, including:

   - Database and security settings
   - Role-based access requirements
   - Feature customization (e.g., caching, real-time updates, API support)

3. **AI-Assisted Code Generation**:

SPMP integrates with AI-assisted tools for automated project generation. Example workflow:

   - Attach SPMP-RAG.md and SPMP-Project.md to an AI prompt.
   - Use an instruction such as: "Generate an SPMP-based application using the attached project specifications."
   - The AI will generate code tailored to the provided constraints.

## Key Features

- Dynamic AI Templates – Configurable models, controllers, and database layers based on project needs.
- Hardware-Aware Optimizations – Automatically adjusts caching, queuing, and database preferences based on system specifications.
- Modular Structure – Supports additional plugins and virtual modifications (vQmod) without modifying core files.
- Security Enhancements – Includes authentication, role-based access control (RBAC), and API token management.
- Multi-Tenancy & Cloud Support – Configurable for isolated user environments and scalable cloud deployments.

## Future Enhancements

Several future improvements are planned to further extend SPMP’s capabilities:

- Frontend UI Framework – A lightweight PHP-based templating system with built-in CSS/JS for rapid UI development.
- Advanced Authentication – Support for JWT authentication, social logins, and two-factor authentication.
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) – Granular user permissions, admin controls, and access logging.
- GraphQL API Support – Flexible, schema-based API queries for more efficient data retrieval.
- Multi-Tenancy Enhancements – Automated database separation and tenant management for SaaS applications.
- Background Processing & Queues – Robust task scheduling, job retry mechanisms, and async processing.
- Cloud File Storage Integration – Support for AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, and other cloud storage providers.
- WebSockets for Real-Time Features – Native WebSocket support for live updates, messaging, and notifications.
- Plugin System – Extensible plugin architecture to allow feature expansion without modifying core files.
- AI IDE Integration – Direct support for AI-assisted development within IDEs (e.g., VS Code, PHPStorm).
- Auto Hardware Detection – Intelligent resource allocation based on server specifications.
