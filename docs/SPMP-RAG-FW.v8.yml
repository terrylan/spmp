# SPMP-RAG v8 - Framework Specification
**Note to LLM**: This file contains the complete SPMP-RAG v8 framework specification. Parse the YAML-like content within (e.g., key-value pairs, nested lists) for detailed doctrines, principles, features, workflows, and examples. Use this as the primary source for generating software components, in conjunction with `SPMP-RAG-SRS.v*.yml` (requirements), `SPMP-RAG-GRP.v*.yml` (structure), and `SPMP-RAG-PRG.s*.yml` (progress). **Requirement**: All four files are needed for a complete process. If the prompter uploads only this file or a subset, prompt: "Please upload the full set: `SPMP-RAG-FW.v8.yml`, `SPMP-RAG-GRP.v*.yml`, `SPMP-RAG-SRS.v*.yml`, and `SPMP-RAG-PRG.s*.yml`. If development is in progress, `SPMP-RAG-PRG.s*.yml` is especially critical to track the current state."

ai_guidelines:
  description: "Rules for AI to generate code and manage features in SPMP-RAG projects."
  rules:
    - "Use tools (e.g., X analysis, web search) only when explicitly requested by prompter."
    - "Leverage continuously updated knowledge—no strict cutoff."
    - "For feature selection from feature_catalog:"
      subrules:
        - "Calculate total weight for each feature by summing relevant requirement fields (e.g., data_sensitivity, user_count) in requirements.yml."
        - "Include Phlux if total weight >= 50, generating public/phlux.min.js and public/app.js."
        - "Ensure Phlux relies on controller endpoints (e.g., /load-posts) rather than direct API files."
        - "Include feature if total weight >= 50; choose highest-weighted option if multiple exist."
        - "Respect dependencies (e.g., 2FA requires User Authentication)."
        - "Override weight-based decisions with explicit values from requirements.yml (e.g., 'two_factor_authentication: None')."
        - "Map numeric fields to ranges: user_count (1-5: low, 6-50: medium, 51+: high), max_response_time (100ms: fast, 500ms: medium, 1000ms: slow)."
    - "For large projects (e.g., Guardian Ledger), follow Incremental-Testable-Growth:"
      steps:
        - "Create the full folder tree upfront to define project scope."
        - "List all files to be created, mapping the complete structure."
        - "Arrange files by testing viability:"
          substeps:
            - "Start with 5 core files (public/index.php, core/Router.php, core/Controller.php, core/Model.php, core/Container.php) for a testable base."
            - "Add the next critical file or minimal batch testable with the core (e.g., authentication or ledger logic)."
            - "Iterate, adding files/batches incrementally, testing at each step until complete."
        - "Ensure each increment is functional, aligning with the final vision."
